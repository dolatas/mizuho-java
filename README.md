# Mizuho - Limit Book Order (Java)
This repository contains a sample project with solution for the technical task assigned by Mizuho. The task was to implement a limit book order, and I was given the freedom to choose the approach I see fit. As a result, I prepared two solutions: one using SpringBoot and Java 17 (separate repository), and another in pure Java (this repository).

Please feel free to explore the project and provide your feedback.
